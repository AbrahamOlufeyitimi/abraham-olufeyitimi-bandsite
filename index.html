                The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, 
                California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead 
                vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. 
                The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, 
                drawing attention from their future manager. Having extensive 
                experience working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager 
                was confident the band could succeed even further with more support, 
                pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record label.
            </p>

            <p class="about__text">
                From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition 
                and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately 
                fell in love with the band’s original and organic attitude, 
                solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and 
                coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves 
                as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and authentic 
                performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording their 
                second studio album, looking to be released in early 2024.
